# How to uninstall Revit completely

The easiest, quickest and cleanest method of uninstalling Revit is with the Autodesk Uninstall Tool. This program is automatically installed with any Autodesk product. 

You can find this tool here: 

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Autodesk Shared\Uninstall Tool\R1
```

Just run `UninstallTool.exe` and select the Revit version you want to uninstall. It will automatically purge every related library and addin.
