# Join structural framing

The behavior of the joining of beams is governed by 2 things:

- the family parameter 'Material for Model Behavior' have to be 'Concrete'
- the visibility of solids in the family have to be visible in all detail levels

Any of these two is not true beams won't (geometry) join.
