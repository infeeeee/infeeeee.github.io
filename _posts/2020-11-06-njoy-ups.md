# nJoy Keen USB UPS in Network UPS Tools

I didn't find about how to use nJoy UPSs in Network UPS Tools on Linux.

nJoy is a romanian manufacturer, produces UPSs, batteries and other hardwares, even laptops. Their UPSs are one of the cheapest ones, so I bought one. Also their design is also catched my eyes, however in IRL they don't look as good as on photos.

## USB

The Keen USB series has an usb port, so it's possible to connect them to a PC.

On their support website they recommend [PowerGuide](http://www.powermonitor.software/#PowerGuideSoftware) software. I tried installing first, it was a nighmare, don't recommend using it.

So I tried to use it with better tools, namely NUT, already integrated in most Linux systems. However this devices aren't supported by NUTS officially.

I tryed some drivers available in NUT, and `blazer_ser` was working.

So my final config in NUTS:

```
driver = blazer_ser
port = /dev/ttyUSB0
```

## Indentification

`dmesg` while connecting:

```
