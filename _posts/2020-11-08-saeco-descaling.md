# Philips Saeco Xsmall descaling extract

It's that time of the year again...

Philips official manual about the semi-annual descaling process of this coffee machine is terrible. The explanations of the process spans four pages in the manual. Also I bought this machine second hand, so I didn't got a manual, and turning pages back and forth in the pdf, while following the process is tiring. So I created an extract, which contains only the steps, without oversized and unnecessary images, straight to the point. 

Download the extract in pdf from here: [pdf](/assets/attachments/Philips%20Saeco%20Xsmall%20Descaling.pdf). Printable in A4 format.

Or in editable docx: [docx](/assets/attachments/Philips%20Saeco%20Xsmall%20Descaling.docx)

And here it is as a png image:

## Disclaimer

It's just an extract, so first time read Philips' official manual. I'm not responsible if you destroy your machine.

The images in the extract are copied from the official manual, without any modification. The manual is available on the internet from multiple sources. Usage of this images falls under fair usage in this case.
